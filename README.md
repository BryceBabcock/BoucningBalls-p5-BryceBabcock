# BoucningBalls-p5-BryceBabcock

This is a test website to host a p5 project we recently learned in CSCI 201 with professor Meng. My p5js editor for this repository: [https://editor.p5js.org/BryceBabcock/sketches/sSzjw9NcB]. Some changes I made to the initial program given to us were, changing the mp3 audio file from an audio file of the moonlanding the the song Bluebird, by Paul McCartney and The Wings. I also changed the color (random to blue) and size of the text (32 to 35) that reads "Hello World!", in the top left corner. I changed the color of the text box color from random to blue, and the background color from white to black. The transparency of the balls was also changed to make them fully non-transparent, which paired better with black background. My final edit was slowing down the balls a bit to match the rythm of the song which is a slower paced. In the file labeled screenshot..., there is an image of the final product. Note: the actual program moves and the audio plays.
